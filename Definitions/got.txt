People think that they're so smart when they come in here as grammar experts when they really don't know a single thing about it. "Got" is a real word and it has a real use and almost no one knows it. People will often say "I [got to go] to the store" when it should be "I have to go to the store". People will also say "I got three dollars" when it should be "I have three dollars". But, the correct usage of "got" is the past tense of "get". This version of "got" should be able to be replaced with "received". For example, "I got a computer last year" IS a [correct English] sentence.

 Definition [36]: 
 An ambiguous term used to express that a potential hook-up/romantic interest/etc. possesses multiple, [unnamed] desirable qualities—most commonly material ones (i.e. desirable physical characteristics, wealth or the [trappings] thereof, etc.)— that the speaker asserts makes the person being spoken about more attractive than other potentials.

"Got" can be seen as [trumping] "hot" when one is choosing between multiple "hot" possibilities.

It is likely/possible that the usage evolved from the more common "[s/he's] hot," either from conventional informal phonetic play or even from internet/typo humor (as in teh), as the "g" character is adjacent to the "h" character on keyboards using the standard qwerty layout.
