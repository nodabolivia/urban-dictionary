 Completly [crazy]. [100]% [insane]. 
 
 
 Urban term 	 ===> 	 Mom 
 Definition [107]: 
 The woman who gave birth to you. She sometimes gets in your face & business, she has mood swings & at times just loses it, but you love her no matter what & she loves you too.
All any mom really wants is to have one day a week to just relax & not have to drive their kids everywhere.

She's the woman who takes care of all the pets you promised to feed & [bathe] but 'forget', the one who buys you almost everything in the world, the one who hugs you when you're upset & always has a shoulder to cry on, the one who deals with anything from [Tampons] to heartbreaks when dads don't, the one who always searches for bargains, & one of the few females who won't start rumors about you & start drama.
In other words, the [crazy lady] well all love.
