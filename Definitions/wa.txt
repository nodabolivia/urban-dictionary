The Japanese postposition (like a [preposition] except after a word) "wa" is the topic [marker], which identifies the topic (duh) of the sentence. The literal meaning is "As for (noun)." Usually the topic and the subject are the same thing, but only if the topic has already been introduced; otherwise, you use the subject marker "ga."
