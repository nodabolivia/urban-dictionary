 Definition [52]: 
 A class required in high school designed to make your day shit. The [driest] assholes from your nearest community college are rounded up and given [worksheets] to keep for their entire teaching career, of which they make endless copies and in an orgy of sadistic joy they throw them at you and tell you to learn. Chemistry itself if the science of the smallest fucking shit in the universe that just so happens to require the most detailed [math problems]. If you know what you're doing, you probably don't.

 Definition [55]: 
 A science in which one extends their knowledge of the [Periodic Table] by occasionally mixing the wrong chemicals, lighting stuff on fire, freezing stuff in [liquid nitrogen], highlighting the hell out of their [periodic table] until it looks like a unicorn licked it, and understanding how all this stuff applies to the [little tiny] bits that make up every last bit of everything.

 Definition [57]: 
 One of the four "[Natural Sciences]" (The others being Maths , Physics and Biology) . Taugt at secondary school , highschool and university.
Firstly taught at 7th grade ( sometime 8th) , chemistry at this level is the study of mole , mass , principles of mass conversion , solutions and compound identification .
Chemistry in highschool mainly focuses on two aspects : Inorganic (10th and 11th Grade) and Organic Chemistry(11th and 12Th grade) .According to students it's one of the most boring subjects ever to have enslaved humanity . Still it's better and more interesting than History , Maths and Physics - The three shits of apocalypse .

After entering college , freshmen often find themselves trapped in the overwhelming matrix of chemistry , cuz there are 5 branches of chemical studies in college and they piss them off. They are:

Inorganic Chemistry : The study of compounds which are non-related to carbon. Nerds love this.
Organic Chemistry : It's fucking complicated but very interesting . Closely related to biology .
Biochemistry : The best subject in college after World of Warcraft .
[Analytical Chemistry] : The study of analyzing reactions , the bastard child of Maths and Physics .Who gives a fuck about this shit ?
[Physical chemistry] : Satan himself .

Conclusion : fucking hard , but still better than Maths , Physics , History and Philosy - The new 4 shits of the grand apocalypse .

 Definition [59]: 
 - An education course often hated by those that do not have the mental capacity to comprehend it.  Often referred to as “boring” and “useless” by ignorant students, but appreciated by those that see its consequences to society and technology.  In college, chemistry is used as a filter class [to weed] out ill prepared or unintelligent pre-meds and other technical field majors.  Serves to re-route them to a more appropriate field such as [sociology], business, or political “science”.  

- A physical science dealing with the world of [atoms] and the molecules they form.  Divided classically into 5 branches: physical, organic, inorganic, [analytical], and biological.
